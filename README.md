# Javascript Quiz Game

## Description

This is a Javascript Quiz Game as assigned by my Bootcap course. The Initial HTML (index.html, highscore.html) and CSS (style.css) were provided by the instruction course, as the module was to show understanding of Jaavscript's event listeners, DOM traversal elements and localStorage. I decided to make some minor edits to the coloring but otherwise, I have opt'd not to adjust the stylesheet. 

This is a short quiz designed to test the user on their JS knowledge. It tracks time on the page, and if the user answers incorrectly, it subtracts time. It also adds that time to the final score. 


## Installation

You can run this code by opening it in your preferred code editor. 

## Usage

When you load into the start page, clicking Start Quiz wil run the quiz game. Answer the questions, and at the end you can enter your initials and have a High Score!
